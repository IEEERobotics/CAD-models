CAD-models
==========

CAD models for IEEE robotics.


NOTE:
If you are going to use this repository for CAD files, you MUST have a folder on your computer with ALL of the part files and assembly files. Sync the pain folder to your git desktop, work on your part of the robot assembly, then commit the changes to git with a nice description of what you did to the robot assembly, then sync to make all changes sync with git and everyone else (don't know if that is actually what will happen, so someone else needs to correct this).
